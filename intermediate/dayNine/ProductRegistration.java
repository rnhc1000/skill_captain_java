/**
 * Assignment: Product Registration System
 * Objective: 
 * Build a simple product registration system in Java that allows users to 
 * register their products and store relevant information.
 * Requirements:
 * 
1. Create a `Product` class with the following attributes:
- `productId` (String): Unique identifier for each product.
- `productName` (String): Name of the product.
- `description` (String): Brief description of the product.
- `manufacturer` (String): Name of the manufacturer.
- `warrantyPeriod` (int): Duration of the product's warranty in months.

2. Create a `ProductRegistrationSystem` class that includes the following functionalities:
- A method to register a new product by accepting input from the user for each attribute of the `Product` class.
- A method to display all registered products along with their details.
- A method to search for a product by its ID and display its information.
- A method to generate a report showing the count of products registered and their warranty status (expired or active).

3. Implement validation checks in the registration process to ensure that all required fields are provided and appropriate data types are used.

4. Utilize appropriate data structures, such as ArrayList or HashMap, to store and manage registered products.

5. Provide a user-friendly command-line interface that allows users to interact with the system, including options to register a product, display product details, search for a product, and generate reports.

6. Include error handling to handle invalid input or exceptional scenarios gracefully.

7. Demonstrate the functionality of the product registration system by registering a few sample products and performing various operations like displaying product details, searching for products, and generating reports.

 * Note: Focus on the core functionality of the product registration system. Advanced features like database integration or graphical user interface (GUI) are optional for this assignment.
